Description: Base library for building wxPython applications
 This is a set of utilities, widgets, and base classes used by
 APCI, LLC and CMM, Inc. in the development of their software.
 At this point, Its primary interest to others will be as a
 source of examples and inspiration as the code is young (thus
 incompatible changes are likely) and can have specific
 expectations in places (we're working on those).
